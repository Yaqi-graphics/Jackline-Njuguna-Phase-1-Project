## Project Goals
The goals for the project are as follows:

   - [x] The primary goal is to find out what kinds of movies make the most revenue.
   - [x] I will achieve this goal by comparing 4 variables against global revenue, to see if there are any strong correlations.
   - [x] These 4 variables are: budget, votes, release month, and genre.
   - [x] I will provide 4 recommendations on how to make more money on a movie, based on the findings from the data.


## Methodology 
   - [x] Get a feel for all provided datasets.
   - [x] Selected 3 interesting datasets to analyze. ("tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz" + "tmdb.movies.csv.gz" + "imdb.title.basics.csv.gz")
   - [x] Determine which variables within the selected datasets can be used to determine the "success" of a film.
   - [x] Perform data cleaning on the three selected datasets.
   - [x] Merge all selected datasets into one.
   - [x] Analyze the merged dataset to extract 4 actionable insights, regarding: budget vs. global revenue, rating vs. global revenue, release date vs. global revenue, genre vs. global revenue.
   - [x] Generate 2 summary tables using Pandas.
   - [x] Export visualizations to tell the "success stories" of the films included in the dataset.
   - [x] Create a presentation to translate the analysis into insights to decide what films should be created.
